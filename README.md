This repository demonstrates a common issue with React Router's wildcard route (`/*`). The wildcard route is intended to catch any unmatched paths and render a 404 page or similar. However, in this case, it interferes with other defined routes, always showing the 404 page regardless of the path. The solution shows how to correctly order routes for proper wildcard route functionality.
